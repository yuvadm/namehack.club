# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that allows you to build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. It's perfect for content-focused websites like blogs, marketing sites, and portfolios.

## Why Astro?

Astro offers several advantages over traditional frameworks:

- **Performance First**: Astro websites are designed to be lightning-fast by default.
- **Content-Focused**: Built with content-heavy websites in mind.
- **Server-First**: Generates HTML on the server, not in the browser.
- **Easy to Use**: Familiar syntax that combines the best parts of HTML, JSX, and markdown.
- **Fully Featured**: Includes everything you need for production.

## Basic Example

Here's a simple Astro component:

```astro
---
// Your component script goes here
const greeting = "Hello, Astro!";
---

<div>
  <h1>{greeting}</h1>
  <p>This is my first Astro site.</p>
</div>
```
